# Virtual Bank System â€“ Microservices Architecture with BFF & WSO2 API Gateway
## Overview
This is a virtual banking system built to demonstrate modern microservices architecture, including:
* Java Spring Boot Microservices
* Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern
* Kafka-based Request/Response Logging
* Centralized WSO2 API Gateway
* OAuth2 & API Key security
* Application-level routing

## Project Goals
* Demonstrate modular architecture via independent services (User, Account, Transaction, Logging)
* Implement secure and scalable communication between services
* Handle API exposure and authentication using WSO2 API Gateway
* Simplify frontend interaction via BFF service
* Log all inter-service communication using Kafka
